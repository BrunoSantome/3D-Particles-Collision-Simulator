# Objects-Collision-Simulator-
In this project we use two different kinds of approaches to store the objects of the simultation; Using an array of structures and using a structure of arrays. 
The first version of the project use sequential execution to get the results whilst the second version use paralel execution with OpenMp library to obtain a better performance and efficiency in execution time.
